# Coming soon
- Localization support
- Generate Profile for Stream Deck with all possible stratagems already configured.
	(What about different models of Stream Deck? I only have Stream Deck Mini.)
- Redo help.html stratagem list to be more accessible (make it semantically correct).
- Redo help.html stratagem copy animation.

# Maybe
- Drop PicoCSS in favour of self made CSS

# Wishful thinking
- Port to Linux (AutoHotkey is not available on Linux)

# Not Possible
- NOT POSSIBLE --- Generate Stream Deck actions ready to be pasted into the software.
	Stream Deck software does not use the clipboard to copy/paste actions.
